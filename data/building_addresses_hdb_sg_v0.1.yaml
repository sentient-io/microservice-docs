  description: |+
   This Data microservice retrieves information on the Singapore Housing Development Board building blocks in Singapore that includes addresses, postal code, latitude and longitude coordinates. Updated monthly

   The HDB POTH programme makes selected public and non-public datasets available to developers and companies to improve their service offerings to benefit the lives of Singapore citizens. Sentient.io is proud to partner with HDB to manage and facilitate the sharing of data for the POTH Programme.
   
   **Note:** As this microservice uses the GET method, developers using this microservice must remember to have their app encode all the input values to be URL friendly (i.e. all spaces and special characters must be replaced). Here’s a reference on [URL encoding](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP).

    Suggested Use Cases:
    - Information from this microservice can be used to build a geo-targeting app with precise map features. 
    
    **Refining queries in the filterdata field using filter types and match types**
    
    The filterdata fields use elasticsearch’s syntax (specifically filter types and match types) to help further refine search results and provide greater flexibility in structuring more sophisticated queries. 
  
    **Filter Types:**
    
    A filter type is a logic operator to which the search results must fulfill certain logical conditions to be returned. The supported match types are&#58;
    
    * **must** - All of the stated conditions must match. Equivalent to an AND operator.
    
      > {"must":[{"range":{"block":{"gte":100}}}]}
    
    * **must_not** - All of the stated conditions must not match. Equivalent to a NOT operator.
      > {"must_not":[{"match":{"street":"avenue 3"}}]}
    
    * **should** - At least one of the stated conditions should match. Equivalent to an OR operator. 
      > {"should":[{"range":{"block":{"lte":200}}}]}
    
    * **filter** - All of the stated conditions that must match. However, results are not scored unlike the other filter types which returns results based on how well the conditions are met.
      > {"filter":[{"match_phrase":{"street":"ang mo kio"}}]}
      
    For a more detailed guide on filter types, [refer to this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/query-dsl-bool-query.html).
    
    Filter types cannot be used alone and must be used in conjunction with a match type to complete the query.
    
    **Match Types:**
    
    A match type is a match operator nested within a filter type that fine-tunes the matching condition of the text search. The supported match types are&#58;
    
    * **match** - Search within a full text field for a single word

      > {"match":{"street":"serangoon"}}

    * **match_phrase** - Search within a full text field

      > {"match_phrase":{"street":"ang mo kio street"}}

    * **match_phrase_prefix** - Search within a full text field with prefix

      > {"match_phrase_prefix":{"street":"ang mo kio"}}

    * **term** - Returns results that contain an exact term in a provided field

      > {"term":{"postalcode":"550151"}}

    * **terms** - Returns results that contain one or more exact terms in a provided field

      > {"terms":{"postalcode":["550151","550152"]}}

    * **range** - Returns results that contain terms within a stipulated range
        > {"range":{"postalcode":{"lte":650347}}}
        > {"range":{"postalcode":{"gte":650347}}}
        > {"range":{"postalcode":{"gte":650347,"lte":760415}}}
      
    * **exists** - Returns results that contain any indexed value for a field
      > {"exists":{ "field": "postalcode"}}

    For a more detailed guide to match types, [refer to this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/term-level-queries.html).
    
    **Forming sophisticated queries using combinations of filter types (in JSON)**
    
    Multiple filter types can be combined together in one query (written in JSON format) to form a very sophisticated query. Here’s one example below&#58;
    
     > {
     > "must":[{"range":{"block":{"gte":100}}}],
     > "should":[{"range":{"block":{"lte":200}}}],
     > "filter":[{"match_phrase":{"street":"ang mo kio"}}],
     > "must_not":[{"match":{"street":"avenue 3"}}]
     > }


    **Sample Queries Based on Use Cases**
    1. **Search the latitude and longitude coordinates for 442 Pasir Ris Drive 6**
    
       Using a filterdata only&#58;
       > filterdata = {"filter":[{"geo_distance": {"distance": "1km","location": "1.368960,103.957980"}}]}
