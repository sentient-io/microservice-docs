    **Refining queries in the filterdata field using filter types and match types**
    The filterdata fields use elasticsearch’s syntax (specifically filter types and match types) to help further refine search results and provide greater flexibility in structuring more sophisticated queries. 
  
    **Filter Types:**
    A filter type is a logic operator to which the search results must fulfill certain logical conditions to be returned. The supported match types are&#58;
    
    * **must** - All of the stated conditions must match. Equivalent to an AND operator.
      > {"must":[{"match":{"name":"technology"}}]}
    * **must_not** - All of the stated conditions must not match. Equivalent to a NOT operator.
      > {"must_not":[{"match":{"yearestablished.e27":"2016"}}]}
    
    * **should** - At least one of the stated conditions should match. Equivalent to an OR operator. 
      > {"should":[{"match":{"status.e27":"active"}}]}
    
    * **filter** - All of the stated conditions that must match. However, results are not scored unlike the other filter types which returns results based on how well the conditions are met.
      > {"filter":[{"exists":{"field":"company.e27"}}]}
      
    For a more detailed guide on filter types, [refer to this](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/query-dsl-bool-query.html).
    
    Filter types cannot be used alone and must be used in conjunction with a match type to complete the query.
    **Match Types:**
    A match type is a match operator nested within a filter type that fine-tunes the matching condition of the text search. The supported match types are&#58;
    
    * **match** - Search within a full text field for a single word
    
      > {"match":{"name":"technology"}}
    
    * **match_phrase** - Search within a full text field
    
      > {"match_phrase":{"name":"nextwave partners"}}
    
    * **match_phrase_prefix** - Search within a full text field with prefix
    
      > {"match_phrase_prefix":{"name":"nextwave partners"}}
    
    * **term** - Returns results that contain an exact term in a provided field
    
      > {"term":{"employeecount.techinasia":"11"}}
    
    * **terms** - Returns results that contain one or more exact terms in a provided field
    
      > {"terms":{"employeecount.techinasia":["11","15"]}}
      
    * **range** - Returns results that contain terms within a stipulated range
    
      > {"range":{"company.techinasia.funding.amount":{"gte":10000000}}}
      > {"range":{"company.techinasia.funding.amount":{"lte":50000000}}}
      > {"range":{"company.techinasia.funding.amount":{"gte":10000000,"lte":50000000}}}
      
    * **exists** - Returns results that contain any indexed value for a field
    
      > {"exists":{"field":"company.e27"}}
    
    **Sample filterdata JSON:**
      > {
      > "must":[{"match":{"name":"technology"}}],
      > "filter":[{"exists":{"field":"company.e27"}}],
      > "should":[{"match":{"status.e27":"active"}}],
      > "must_not":[{"match":{"yearestablished.e27":"2016"}}]
      > }

            Simple keyword search for matches in all searchable fields. Keywords separated by spaces will return results containing any of those keywords. For exact phrase match, put entire phrase in double quotes (" ").
            
            If this field is set to null, by default the microservice will return all start ups (within the stated limit), which can be further refined through the filterdata field for more sophisticated queries.
