  title: HDB Covered Linkway (SG)
  x-subscribelink: hdb_covered_linkway
  description: |+
      This Data microservice returns the indicative center path of covered linkways for all HDB Towns and Estates and mainly on HDB Land (excluding leased land).  The ""Center Line"" was created manually from the actual linkway surface (polygon) and is therefore only an estimate of the center path of the real object. The quality/accuracy of the linkway polygon section's coordinates is also indicated by whether the section was Fully Visible, Partially Visible or Extrapolated at the point of the image capture.</br>

      Offset can be expected for linkways captured above ground level due to geometric distortion common with remote sensing such as aerial imagery.</br>
    
      A successful call will return the results of the query in JSON format.</br>
    
      The HDB POTH programme makes selected public and non-public datasets available to developers and companies to improve their service offerings to benefit the lives of Singapore citizens. Sentient.io is proud to partner with HDB to manage and facilitate the sharing of data for the POTH programme.

    **Match Types:**
    A match type is a match operator. The supported match types are&#58;
    * **match_phrase** - Search within a full text field
      > {"match_phrase":{"properties.quality":"FULLY VISIBLE"}}    
    * **match** - Search within a full text field for a single word
      > {"match":{"properties.quality":"FULLY VISIBLE"}}
    * **exists** - Returns results that contain any indexed value for a field
      > {"exists":{"field":"properties.featid"}}
    * **geo_distance** - Returns the geo search based on the distance and location lat/long
      > {"geo_distance": {"distance": "11km","geometry": "1.3672863083071272,103.84016886318425"}}
    * **geo_shape** - Returns the geo search based on the type and coordinates.
        relation should be anyone based on requirement.</br>
          > INTERSECTS - (default) Return all documents whose geo_shape field intersects the query geometry.
          > DISJOINT - Return all documents whose geo_shape field has nothing in common with the query geometry.
          > WITHIN - Return all documents whose geo_shape field is within the query geometry. 
        type should be
          > polygon - defined by a list of a list of points. The first and last points in each (outer) list must be the same (the polygon must be closed)
          > points  - single geographic coordinate, such as the location of a building or the current position given by a smartphoneâ€™s Geolocation API.
