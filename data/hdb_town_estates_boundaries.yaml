  title: HDB Town and Estate Boundaries (SG)
  x-subscribelink: hdb_town_estate
  description: |+
      This Data microservice returns the (polygon) coordinates of the boundaries of HDB towns/estates.</br>

      These boundaries:
      
      - define areas for carrying out landuse planning to facilitate development of the HDB towns/estates
      - are used for planning and development within HDB towns/estates (e.g. HDB’s Building Plan and provision of facilities within HDB towns by relevant agencies) 
      - are used for reporting of HDB statistics (eg. HDB flats under management by towns as in HDB’s annual report).</br>
      
      The boundaries are digitised mainly following the URA’s DGP/Planning boundary or road/drain as physical boundary. The boundary will be updated as and when new areas are earmarked by URA for public housing development.</br>
      
      A successful call will return the results of the query in JSON format.</br>
      
      The HDB POTH programme makes selected public and non-public datasets available to developers and companies to improve their service offerings to benefit the lives of Singapore citizens. Sentient.io is proud to partner with HDB to manage and facilitate the sharing of data for the POTH programme.

    **Match Types:**
    A match type is a match operator. The supported match types are&#58;
    * **match_phrase** - Search within a full text field
      > {"match_phrase":{"properties.nme_bndry": "YISHUN"}}
    * **match** - Search within a full text field for a single word
      > {"match":{"properties.nme_bndry": "YISHUN"}}
    * **exists** - Returns results that contain any indexed value for a field
      > {"exists":{"field":"properties.object_id"}}
    * **geo_distance** - Returns the geo search based on the distance and location lat/long
      > {"geo_distance": {"distance": "11km","geometry": "1.4250001817500824, 103.85405924302191"}}
    * **geo_shape** - Returns the geo search based on the type and coordinates.
        relation should be anyone based on requirement.</br>
          > INTERSECTS - (default) Return all documents whose geo_shape field intersects the query geometry.
          > DISJOINT - Return all documents whose geo_shape field has nothing in common with the query geometry.
          > WITHIN - Return all documents whose geo_shape field is within the query geometry. 
        type should be
          > polygon - defined by a list of a list of points. The first and last points in each (outer) list must be the same (the polygon must be closed)
          > points  - single geographic coordinate, such as the location of a building or the current position given by a smartphone’s Geolocation API.
