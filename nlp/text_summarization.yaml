    title: Text Summarization
    description: |+
      This NLP microservice takes in any given input text blurb and generates a summary of up to a maximum of 168 words. 

      The input text should be a minimum of 100 words and a maximum of 512 words. 

      For longer text, we suggest breaking them up into smaller chunks and making multiple calls to this microservice for more effective summarization.

All 12 public housing developments in Bidadari have been rolled out, with the final three projects - Bartley GreenRise, ParkEdge @ Bidadari and Alkaff Breeze - launched in this month's BTO sales exercise.Bartley GreenRise will be the last BTO site to be ready, and is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2025. The BTO flats in the 93ha Bidadari estate have been highly sought after by home seekers. The five-room flats typically drew more applicants than there were available units.This is despite Bidadari's past as a grave site, with some drawing similarities between the estate and the mature town of Bishan, which was also once a cemetery.Most of the units in Alkaff LakeView and Alkaff CourtView have been designed with structural columns tucked to the edges to allow residents greater flexibility in configuring their home layouts."
