        Load Planning Engine API is to give client recommendation on how to load cargoes inside a vehicle. The LPE API can be used together with the Fleet Routing Engine API. The API will also give the client visualization of the load plan in 6 different viewing angles. If the payload includes pickup and delivery types of jobs, the load plan will be separated. All the cargo wil be treated as a box shape and all cargoes inside a same job ID will be grouped into one big box.
