  description: |+
    This Analytics microservice is part of a business rule management system which executes a set of rules or condition in a runtime production environment. Such rules are used to process data and if any condition matches then it executes the corresponding actions.</br>
    This microservice only provides the inference (processing objects based on predefined rules), while the creation of the projects and objects and definition of rules is handled by a separate user-interface.
