  title: Face Recognition
  description: |+
    This Computer Vision microservice recognises faces of Singaporean and Japanese public figures (e.g. athletes, business leaders, celebrities, politicians, TV personalities, etc). </br>
    This microservice returns the identity of the person, the bounding box in image coordinates, and the confidence of the prediction. Users can further filter the results by countries, profession or even down to the individual names.  </br>
    Help us grow this microservice! [Let us know](https://www.sentient.io/contact) which other public figures you would like this microservice to recognise (e.g. a new country or a new category). We will expand the capability of this microservices based on user feedback and demand.</br>
    The size of your image file **should not exceed 10 MB**
