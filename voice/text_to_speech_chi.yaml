    - Voice bots in contact centers - Deliver a better voice experience for customer service by dynamically generating speech, instead of playing static, pre-recorded audio. Engage with synthesized voices that give callers a sense of familiarity and personalization.

    - Voice generation in devices - Enable natural communications with users by empowering your devices to speak humanlike voices. Build an end-to-end voice user interface together with Speech-to-Text and improve user experience with easy and engaging interactions.

    - Accessible EPGs (Electronic Program Guides) - Implement text-to-speech functionality in EPGs to provide a better user experience to customers and meet accessibility requirements for services and applications.
