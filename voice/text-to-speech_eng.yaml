  description: |+
    This Voice microservice converts English text to speech in a female voice.
    User can adjust the pitch and tempo of the the synthesised speech. 
    The Text-to-Speech AI generated synthesized voice speaks with a Singaporean English accent. Where necessary, the user can also fine-tune the pronunciation of specific words by using ARPABET notation (see Additional Details section below).
    
    The input text **should not exceed 3000 characters**.
  x-additionalinfo : |+
    - Users can now define custom phonetic pronunciations using ARPABET notation enclosed within curly brackets { }. For example, note the difference in how “tomatoes” is pronounced using the following 2 inputs:
    - plain text: I like to eat tomatoes
    - text with ARPABET: I like to eat {T AH0 M AE1 T OW0 Z}
      See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET for full list of ARPABET notation.
